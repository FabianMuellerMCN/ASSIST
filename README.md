Code underlying the data analysis of: Virtual reality gaze exposure treatment reduces fear of public speaking: A randomized controlled trial

Abstract:
Fear of public speaking is widespread. While sufferers typically avoid eye contact with the audience it is not known if reducing gaze avoidance can alleviate their fear. 
We developed a stand-alone, virtual reality (VR) gaze exposure treatment and tested its effectiveness in a single-blind, parallel-group, 
randomized controlled trial in 89 healthy adults with fear of public speaking. The gaze exposure focused on the maintenance of eye contact 
with virtual audiences across increasingly difficult social situations. The primary outcome was subjective fear in a real-life public speaking 
test assessed at baseline, after a single 1-h app use (phase 1), and after additional repeated (9 × 20 min) app use at home (phase 2). 
After phase 2, but not phase 1, participants in the treatment condition showed significantly reduced fear compared the control 
condition (Cohen’s d = 1.07, P &lt; .0001). The repeated use of a VR-based gaze exposure treatment leads to a large reduction of fear 
in a real-life speech situation, suggesting high effectiveness of a treatment focused on gaze behavior.
